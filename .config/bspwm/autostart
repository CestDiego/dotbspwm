# STARTUP ICON TRAY
#

# We are using stalonetray to create a small icon tray at the
# top right of the screen. You are likely to want to tweak the
# size of the icons and the width of the tray based upon the
# size of your screen and your xmobar configuration. The goal is
# to make stalonetray look like it is part of xmobar.
# 
# Line by line, the options used by default below mean:
# - icons should be aligned with the "East" or right side of the tray
# - the width of the tray should be 5 icons wide by one icon tall, and it 
#   should be located 0 pixels from the right of the screen (-0) and 0 pixels
#   from the top of the screen (+0).
# - By setting our maximum geometry to the same thing, the tray will not grow.
# - The background color of the tray should be black.
# - This program should not show up in any taskbar.
# - Icons should be set to size "24".
# - Kludges argument of "force_icons_size" forces all icons to really, truly 
#   be the size we set.
# - window-strut "none" means windows are allowed to cover the tray. In
#   other words, trust xmonad to handle this part.
